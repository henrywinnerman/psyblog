							<h2>Motion</h2>

							<p>Motion is the phenomenon which describes the change of poition of on object with respect to time</p>
							<h4><b>Terms associated with Motion</b></h4>

							<p>1. Distance : Distance ca be defined as the measurement of how far apart objects are, from a starting point to its ending point.<br>Distance is calculated as Speed x Time. Distance is a scalar quantity. Distance is measured in metres(m)</p>
							<p>2. Speed: The speed of an object is the distance travelled by the object divided by the time taken to cover the distance.</p>
							<p>3. Time : time is defined as the measure of progreesion of evemts. S.I unit of time is seconds(s)</p>
							<p>4. Displacement: Displacement is synonymous to distance, the only difference is that displacement describes moving an object from its position. It is a vector quantity.</p>

							<p>5. Velocity: Velocity is the rate of displacement with respect to time taken. We have : i) Initial veloity and ii) Final Velocity.<br>Initial Velocity describes the velocity a body posses before it takes off, if a body starts from rest, the initial velocity is zero, while Final velocity is the velocity the body has after completing the journey. The S.I unit is m/s2. Velocity is a vector quantity.</p>

							<p>6. Acceleration: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time taken. this is calculated as Final Velocity - Initial Velocity/Time taken. This is represented as V - U/ T.</p>

							<p>Final velocity = V, Initial Velocity = U, Time = T. The unit of acceleration is m/s2. Acceleration is a vector quantity</p>

							<h2>Types of Motion</h2>
							<p>1. Random Motion: This is a type of motion in a zigzag manner. an example of this type of motion is called the Brownian motion. Brownian motion is the constant but irregular zigzag motion of small colloidal particles such as smoke, soot, dust, or pollen that can be seen quite clearly through a microscope.</p>

							<p>2. Linear Motion: This is motion in a straight line. </p>


							<p>3. Perodic Motion: Periodic motion is defined as a motion that repeats itself after certain intervals of time. Simply, it is a movement that is repeated after a fuxed time is completed. For example, the hands of a clock.</p>


							<p>3. Oscillatory Motion: Oscillatory motion is defined as the ti and from movement of an object from a fixed position. It is expected that in the absence 0f friction, the oscillatory motion continues on and on, but in he real world it eventually settles in an equilibrum. Examples of oscillatory motiom are: moving of a simple pendulum (Example: Simple Harmonic Motion), vibrating strings if a plucked guitar, movement of spring. </p>


							<p>4. Circular Motion:  circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path.It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation.</p>


							<p>5. Relative Motion: This is the motion of an object or a body with respect to another one that is fixed. an example of relative motion is the motion of a person in a moving vehicle with respect to the trees, sign posts outisde.</p>
